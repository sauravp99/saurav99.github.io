												<h3>Goal</h3>
											</header>
											<p> The goal of this project was to develop an application in Android Studio implemented with Kotlin. Amongst the presented cases, our team chose
												to work with the resources available from api.nve.no, that gave us data from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate. 
												The team consisted of five members; 2 programmers and 3 designers and my role was assigned to UX lead and design moderator</p>

												<h3>Research</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	The choice of API steered our team into a certain direction regarding choice of target group and which challenges we 
												chose to face. 
												The team started by exploring the API and what resources were available for us to utilize. 
												We discovered that the API contained information on various types of natural disasters such as Avalanches, mudslides and floods and saw a potential in
												adapting this into our solution. After reviewing several potential target groups(truck-drivers, campers, hikers) that could have some relation to 
												these types of disasters, our team chose to focus on <strong>Tour-goers</strong> as our target group.  We proceeded to collect data to identify the different 
												practices and habits of our target-group, we placed a focus on identifying what solutions they that preferred earlier.

												<h3>Requirements</h3>

											<p> Our vision for the project became more clear after analysis of the data collected.
												The team conducted a total of 5 interviews for collecting information from several participants in the target group. 
												These were the main requirements identified after analysis of the data: </p>

												<h3>Development</h3>
											</header>
											<p> During the course of the next 2 months, the team went ahead with planning, developing and testing of our solution. We had chosen 
												Kanban as our agile project management method and managed our current/remaining tasks on Trello. We utilized Github in order to collaboratively
												work on the application. Due to the pandemic, nearly all of our meetings were held online on Discord, which worked better than expected.
												During the course of our work, a project report (that reached 52 pages) was also being worked on.</p>

												<h3>Design</h3>

											<p> The design of our solution was developed togheter on Adobe XD, this was due to several of us 
												having prior knowledge with the software. We went ahead with creating some wireframes to present to each other and eventually
												landed upon a final layout choice.

												<h3>Solution</h3>
											</header>
											<p>TripGuard is ment to ensure a safe journey for tour-goers out in nature. The application can be utilized 
												for safely planning trips beforehand or during the trip. The user can check whether or not an area is exposed to natural disasters such as 
												avalanches, mud slides or floods. In addition, by using the users location, the app can provide real-time notifications based on the users 
												position.<br> We utilized Dokka to generate documentation for our code. 
												The structure of our application is designed according to the Model View ViewModel which seperates the data (Model) from the UI (View) then uses the ViewModel
												to create a link to transfrom and provide a datastream to the view. This allowed to design the app with one single <em>activity</em> with several <em>fragments</em>
												Various libraries () were also used to implement nessecary functionality. In app is also responsive with a flexible UI <br>
												The project files have not yet been publiced but can be provided through
												request.

												<h3>Reflection</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	
												<ul>
													<li>Due to the sudden Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to physically meet up with the participants as desired. This presented some issues, some technical
														and some sosial. However, we overcame these challenges with videocalls, screen sharing for presenting ideas and sharing information and stable tools such as 
														Zoom.</li>
													<li>Some of our participants had a significant age gap, it was interesting to understand how their needs differed (regarding sosial contact, tech skills..) besides those that were common
													</li>
													<li>During the course of this project i gained significant amount of experience in working on Github, Trello, android Studio and Kotlin. 
														I managed to create fast wireframes using Adobe XD and also created the logo for our app.
													</li>
													<li>ur wireframing process was cut somewhat short due to the limited timeframe and what the team collectively chose to
														focus more on (which was functionality). This was somewhat regrettable for me as a designer but i was happy with the final outcome 
													nonetheless</li>
												</ul>
