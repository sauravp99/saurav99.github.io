												<h3>Problem</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Our goal with this group project was to develop an application using Android Studio and successfully
												collect information from an API of choice. We set our focus on utlilizing resources from api.nve.no that gave us
												data from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate.
												The team consisted of five members; 2 programmers and 3 designers. My role was assigned to UX lead and design moderator</p>

												<h3>Research</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	After reviewing several potential target groups(truck-drivers, campers..), our team chose to focus on a more broad target group, <strong>Tour-goers</strong>.
												We proceeded to identify which challenges tour-goers experienced, what solutions they preferred and their habits.
												Our project team conducted a total of 5 interviews for collecting information on our target group. Due to the sudden
												Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to physically meet up with the participants as desired. By interviewing different age groups,
												it was interesting to understand how their needs differed (regarding sosial contact, tech skills..) besides those that were common. We identified these 
												key user stories --> </p>

											<p> During the course of 3 months, we completed planning, development and testing of our solution. We had chosen Kanban as our agile project management method and through various tools such as 
												Trello, Github and Adobe XD, we successfully reached completion. At the end, a project report 
												of 52 pages was compiled and delivered.</p>

												<h3>Solution</h3>
											</header>
											<p>TripGuard is ment to ensure a safe journey for tour-goers out in nature. The application can be utilized 
												for safely planning trips beforehand or during the trip. The user can check whether or not an area is exposed to natural disasters such as 
												avalanches, mud slides or floods. In addition, by using the users location, the app can provide real-time notifications based on the users 
												position. The app is created in Android Studio and written in Kotlin. The project files have not yet been publiced but can be provided through
												request.
