												<h3>Problem</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Food waste is a huge contributor to harming the environment. Every year, Norwegian households 
												throw away more than 217,480 tonnes of food. Our team of 4 set out to minimize this problem through developing a prototype with the use of 
												Arduino Uno. Our problem statement: <br> <i> "How can we assist households with reducing food waste" </i> <br>

												<h3>Research</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We set our focus on families in a house and chose this as our target group. For understanding their needs we conducted two semi-structured interviews
												and 1 diary study. This included one with a common household and also a sit down with the renovation agency of Oslo Commune.
												These were the needs established:
												<br>Need for <strong> Visibility | Information | Simplicity | Indepandance </strong><br>

												<h3>Prototyping</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In the next step, our team started on our idea creation journey. We spent time quickly
												creating and reviewing multiple sketches.<br>											
												Various ideas:
												<ul>
												<li>Thin metal plate with sensors that get detect if something is placed on top. Easy to be slid right onto the fridge shelf.
												With the knob on the front, user can set a timer for cooling the item. The mechanisms of a cooling plate would help the leftovers stay fresh for longer.
												<li>Physical board game with the concept of gamifaction, these ideas (however interesting) were not further worked on due to shortage of time</li>
												</ul>
												Reflection: Better time management for more idea creation wouldve been more suitable, not spending more time exploring our ideas was unfortunate and somewhat regrettable in hindsight.

												<h3>Solution</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We could relate to the problem of forgetting leftovers in the fridge til they went bad. We also understand how kids had issues knowing if the 
												food was still fresh to eat. Our solution combines light elements with a storage box design, it is able to fit tidly in the fridge and provide visual indiciation with LEDs.
												The prototype concists of two parts: <br>
												<ul>
													<li>Main control hub | User can choose between general categories (fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, dairy) depending on the type of leftovers. If the user has prepared a dish
														containing elements in several of the cateories, the timer is set with consideration for the type with the lowest expiration estimate</li>
													<li>Storage box | User places the leftovers and after user has selected a category, a timer starts and the lights turn from green to yellow to red, visually indicating
														whether the food is fresh/still safe/throw away</li>
													</ul> </p>
