												<h3>Problem</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Food waste is a huge contributor to harming the environment. Every year, Norwegian households 
												throw away more than 217,480 tonnes of food. Our team of 4 set out to minimize this problem through developing a prototype with the use of 
												Arduino Uno. Our problem statement: <br> <i> "How can we assist households with reducing food waste" </i> <br>

												<h3>Research</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We set our focus on families living in a household and chose this as our target group. For understanding their needs we conducted two semi-structured interviews
												and 1 diary study. This included one with a common household and also a sit down with the renovation agency of Oslo Commune. The interviews gave us good knowledge on which
												challenges the family fased and through our diary study we learned about their practices in their own context.
												For instance, we discovered that the children felt dependent on their parents for verifying 
												whether the food was still edible or not.
												After analysing the data through coding transcribtions and creating affinity diagrams, these were the needs established:
												<br>Need for <strong> Visibility | Information | Simplicity | Indepandance </strong><br>

												<h3>Prototyping</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In the next step, our team started on our idea creation journey. We spent quite some time brainstorming, generating and reviewing multiple sketches.<br>											
												Some of our ideas included:
												<ul>
												<li>Thin metal plate with sensors that get detect if something is placed on top. Easy to be slid right onto the fridge shelf.
												With the knob on the front, user can adjust the temperatur for cooling the item. The mechanisms of a cooling plate would help the leftovers stay fresh for longer.
												<li>Various board game designs with the concept of gamifaction</li>
												</ul>
												We also created some physical prototypes of cardboard to demonstrate use.
												These were then brought to the family for evaluation and were further improved based on their feedback.

												<h3>Solution</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After several iterations of prototyping and evaluating with our participants, we managed to produce a solution that 
												would contribute to reducing food wastage in a family household<br><br>
												
												Each of us could relate to the problem of forgetting leftovers in the fridge, only to find them spoilt after awhile. We could also understand how kids had issues knowing if the 
												food was still fresh to eat or if it had to be thrown away. Our solution combines light elements with a storage box design to fit tidly in the fridge and provide visual indiciation with LEDs.
												The family can place their food in the box and start the timer based on food category, then over time, the box will shift color depending on how long the food has stayed there.
												The prototype (made with arduino uno) concists of two parts: <br>
												<ul>
													<li>Main control hub | User can choose between general categories (fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, dairy) depending on the type of leftovers. If the user has prepared a dish
														containing elements in several of the cateories, the timer is set with consideration for the type with the lowest expiration estimate</li>
													<li>Storage box | User places the leftovers and after user has selected a category, a timer starts and the lights turn from green to yellow to red, visually indicating
														whether the food is fresh/still safe/throw away</li>
												</ul> </p>

											<h3>Reflection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Our idea creation process should have been more elaborate, with more time spent creating physical lo-fi prototypes ready for evaluation.
										As this was my first real design process, it was quite knowledgeable and gave me a good insight on how to plan, perform and analyse interviews with 
										real users. I also got alot of experience programming a micro controller (we used arduino uno) and how to integrate it with creating a working prototype.<br>
										During the idea creation phase, their is usually a creative phase, where there is a
										open flow of creative suggestions without any filter. Then during the critical phase, 
										the ideas get filtered depending on whether they are possible to work with. These 
										two phases collapsed during our project, resulting in innovative ideas being scraped too early.
