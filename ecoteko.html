												<h3>Problem</h3>
											</header>
											<p> Food waste is a huge contributor to harming the environment. Every year, Norwegian households 
												throw away more than 217,480 tonnes of food. Our team of 4 set out to minimize this problem through developing a prototype with the use of 
												Arduino Uno. Our problem statement: <br> <i> "How can we assist households with reducing food waste" </i> <br>

												<h3>Research</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We set our focus on families in a house and chose this as our target group. For understanding their needs we conducted two semi-structured interviews
												and 1 diary study. This included one with a common household and also a sit down with the renovation agency of Oslo Commune.
												These were the needs established:
												<br>Need for <strong> Visibility | Information | Simplicity | Indepandance </strong><br>

												<h3>Prototyping</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In the next step, our team started on our idea creation journey. We spent time exploring 
												possibilities and creating and reviewing multiple sketches.<br>											
												Various ideas:<br>
												|Thin metal plate with sensors that get detect if something is placed on top. Easy to be slid right onto the fridge shelf.
												With the knob on the front, user can set a timer with a estimate on how long the food will last. A light diode flashes when  
												the timer is up.
												| <br>
												|Physical board game with the concept of gamifaction
												|
												We landed on a viable solution.

												<h3>Solution</h3>
											</header>
											<p>We could relate to the problem of forgetting leftovers in the fridge til they went bad. We also understand how kids had issues knowing if the 
												food was still fresh to eat. Our solution combines light elements with a storage box design, it is able to fit tidly in the fridge and provide visual indiciation with LEDs.
												The prototype concists
												When object is detected, a timer starts and the lights turn from yellow to orange to red, visually indicating
												whether the food is fresh/still safe/throw away</p>
