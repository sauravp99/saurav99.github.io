												<h3>Problem</h3>
											</header>
											<!-- <i>While more than four out of ten immigrants say that they often or sometimes feel lonely, less than two out of ten Norwegians report the same.
												Poor contact with Norwegian society and weakened family networks contribute to social isolation.</i> -->
											<p> Sosial isolation refers to the disconnet between yourself and the society you live in. This feeling can directly affect an individauls mental health, 
												which could lead to lonieliness and depression. Especially affected by this can be those that migrate to another country, due to clash of cultures or other barriers. In this project, our team wanted to discover
												a solution for our problem statment: <br> <i> How can we help lower the feeling of isolation among immigrants between 30-50 years who have recently moved to Norway?</i>

												<h3>Research</h3>
											</header>
											<p> For this project, we defined our target group as <strong>immigrants between 30-50 years who have recently moved to Norway</strong>. Our main participants were our parents, who previously had been in the target group, and have now been settled in Norway. Learning about their experiences on moving to 
												Norway, their workarounds and adaptations gave us valueble insight on designing a solution for people who will eventually move to Norway in the future. Our team conducted several semi-structured interviews with our participants aswell as with a couple of language cafes (more on this further down).
												Through our and  data collection and analysis with Affinity Diagram, we identified these interconnected themes: 
											<ul>
												<li>Overcoming language barriers</li>
												<li>Understanding cultural differences</li>
												<li>Recieving base knowledge and acquiring the correct information</li>
												<li>Becoming independant</li>
												<li>Attaining a stabile and consistent lifestyle</li>
											</ul>

											<p> Our team performed three iterations with prototyping - evaluation with the participants.
												The purpose was to narrow down the design to best fit the preferences of our target group. During our
												research, we discovered that a language cafe worked as a nice arena for new immigrants to socialize with each other, 
												develop their langauge skills and learn more about the norwegian culture. We took this into consideration and produced 
												general ideas based on their needs and also those that could be utilized within a language cafe. 
												As our iterations went on, our users and us focused more on the idea of connecting people togheter in these language cafe
												by <strong>motivating</strong> them to go there.

												<h3>Solution</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After several evaluation and redesigns, our final solution took shape of a <strong>progression tree</strong> that
												helps people keep track of how often they visit a language cafe. The leaves on the tree contain small LED diodes
												that light up once the user has returned from logging their visit at the cafe. A prize will be awarded at the cafe
												when a user logs in to the cafe with the final leaf. The solution is meant to motivate people to go visit a language 
												cafe on a regular to improve their confidence and independance in Norway.

											<h3>Reflection</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The strength of our team really showed during the iterative idea creation processes.
											Our journey took us from attempting to force a new creation to realizing how we could utilize
											the resources already availible in our community, that already work. This process really sharpened my
											project planning skills and working with a solution with focus on tangible interaction.
